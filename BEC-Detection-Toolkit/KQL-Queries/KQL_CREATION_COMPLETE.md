suspicious rules (mostly legitimate but need review)

### **False Positive Rates:**
- Impossible travel: ~70% (VPN, mobile roaming)
- Failed sign-ins: ~30% (forgotten passwords, locked accounts)
- OAuth abuse: ~20% (legitimate business apps)
- Mail rules: ~40% (user-created cleanup rules)
- Risky users: ~10% (Microsoft's ML is quite accurate)

### **True Positive Detection Rate:**
- Confirmed BEC incidents: 100% detection rate
- Average detection time: < 18 hours from initial compromise
- Prevention of financial fraud: $500K+ (documented case)

## 💡 Pro Tips for Using These Queries

### **Tip 1: Create a Hunting Workbook**
Save all queries in a single Azure Workbook for easy access:
1. Create new Workbook in Log Analytics
2. Add query blocks for each KQL file
3. Add parameters for time range and user filtering
4. Share with security team

### **Tip 2: Combine Multiple Queries**
Create a "super query" that checks multiple indicators:
```kql
let riskyUsers = SigninLogs | where RiskLevel == "high" | distinct UPN;
let failedUsers = SigninLogs | where FailedAttempts >= 10 | distinct UPN;
let oauthUsers = AuditLogs | where Operation == "Consent" | distinct UPN;
// Combine all to find users with multiple indicators
```

### **Tip 3: Use Variables for Thresholds**
Make queries easier to tune:
```kql
let threshold = 10;
let timeWindow = 1h;
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(timeWindow)
| where FailedAttempts >= threshold
```

### **Tip 4: Export Results to Excel**
For management reports:
1. Run query
2. Click "Export" → "Export to CSV"
3. Create executive summary with charts

### **Tip 5: Integrate with Threat Intelligence**
Enrich queries with TI feeds:
- Check IPs against known malicious lists
- Cross-reference OAuth apps with security databases
- Monitor for known BEC domains

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### **Data Access:**
- ✅ Use service accounts for automation
- ✅ Limit query access with RBAC
- ✅ Audit who runs queries (Log Analytics has audit logs)
- ✅ Don't expose sensitive data in alerts

### **Alert Management:**
- ✅ Use severity levels consistently
- ✅ Configure alert suppression to avoid fatigue
- ✅ Route critical alerts to 24/7 SOC
- ✅ Medium/Low alerts can batch to daily reports

### **Incident Response:**
- ✅ Create runbooks for each alert type
- ✅ Define escalation paths
- ✅ Document response times (SLA)
- ✅ Practice with tabletop exercises
