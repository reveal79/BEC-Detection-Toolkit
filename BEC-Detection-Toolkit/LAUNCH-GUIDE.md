**Title:** 
```
[Open Source] Free BEC Detection Toolkit for Microsoft 365 - No More $100K Security Tools
```

**Body:**
```
After our company was targeted in a $500K+ BEC attack, I built this detection 
toolkit using native Microsoft 365 tools. It helped us catch the attack in 
under 18 hours.

I just open-sourced it so everyone can benefit.

**What's included:**
✅ 3 PowerShell scripts for automated detection
✅ 30+ KQL hunting queries for Sentinel/Log Analytics  
✅ Detects malicious mail rules, impossible travel, OAuth abuse, credential attacks
✅ Complete documentation (installation, usage, troubleshooting)
✅ Works with any M365 tenant out of the box
✅ 100% free - MIT License

**Why I built this:**
Most BEC detection tools (Darktrace, CrowdStrike, Proofpoint) cost $100K-500K/year. 
Small and mid-size organizations can't afford that, but they're prime BEC targets.

This toolkit provides comparable detection capabilities using only PowerShell and 
native Microsoft 365 features. No additional licensing required.

**Production tested:**
- 600+ mailbox environment
- Caught real BEC incident
- Prevented major financial fraud
- Battle-tested over 6 months

**Perfect for:**
- Organizations without big security budgets
- MSPs managing multiple M365 tenants
- IT teams building detection programs
- Anyone protecting Microsoft 365 environments

```
🎉 Excited to announce: I just open-sourced my BEC Detection Toolkit!

After our organization faced a Business Email Compromise attack that could 
have cost $500K+, I built detection automation using PowerShell and KQL 
queries. The toolkit helped us detect and contain the incident in under 
18 hours.

Now I'm making it available to the security community for free.

🎯 What's included:
• 3 PowerShell detection scripts
• 30+ KQL hunting queries for Azure Sentinel/Log Analytics
• Comprehensive documentation (installation, usage, troubleshooting)
• Production-tested in 600+ mailboxes
• Completely free & open source (MIT License)

🔍 Detection capabilities:
• Malicious mail rules (hiding/deleting internal emails)
• Impossible travel patterns
• Credential attacks (brute force, password spray)
• OAuth application abuse
• Azure AD risky users
• Mailbox permission abuse
• And more...

💡 Perfect for:
• SMBs without enterprise security budgets
• MSPs managing multiple M365 tenants
• IT/Security teams building detection programs
• Anyone protecting Microsoft 365 environments

The toolkit provides capabilities comparable to tools costing $100K-500K/year,
using only built-in Microsoft 365 features and PowerShell.

#### **Follow-up Tweet Thread (2 hours later):**

```
🧵 Thread: How this toolkit detects BEC attacks (and why you need it)

1/ Business Email Compromise costs organizations $2+ billion per year. 
   Most companies can't afford Darktrace, CrowdStrike, or Proofpoint.

2/ After experiencing a real BEC attack, I built detection automation 
   using PowerShell and KQL. It caught the attack in < 18 hours.

3/ The toolkit detects 10+ BEC indicators:
   - Malicious mail rules hiding emails from IT/Security
   - Impossible travel (sign-ins from different countries in minutes)
   - OAuth app abuse (attackers granting apps mailbox access)
   - Credential attacks

4/ What makes it unique:
   ✅ Uses ONLY native M365 features (no extra licensing)
   ✅ Production-tested (600+ mailboxes)
   ✅ Complete documentation
   ✅ Works out-of-the-box
   ✅ Open source (MIT License)

5/ Perfect for:
   - SMBs without big security budgets
   - MSPs managing multiple tenants
   - Security teams building detection
   - Students learning threat detection

6/ Just open-sourced it! Check it out and let me know what you think:

# How I Built a Free BEC Detection Toolkit That Stopped a $500K Fraud

## The Incident That Started It All

[Tell the story of your BEC incident - without sensitive details]
- How you discovered it
- What the attackers did
- How you responded
- Financial impact prevented

## The Problem with Current Solutions

- Enterprise BEC detection costs $100K-500K/year
- Most organizations can't afford Darktrace, CrowdStrike, Proofpoint
- SMBs are prime BEC targets but have smallest budgets
- Native M365 tools exist but aren't automated

## Building the Solution

1. Malicious mail rules
2. Impossible travel
3. OAuth abuse
4. Credential attacks
5. Risky users

[Include code snippets showing key detection logic]

### Technical Challenges:
- Performance at scale (600+ mailboxes)
- False positive reduction
- Automation without SIEM
- Cross-platform compatibility

## The Results

- Production-tested for 6 months
- Detected real compromise in < 18 hours
- Prevented $500K+ fraud
- Now protecting [X] organizations

## Open Sourcing the Toolkit

Why I decided to open source:
- Security should be accessible
- Community can improve it
- Help organizations without big budgets

What's included:
- 3 PowerShell scripts
- 30+ KQL queries
- Complete documentation
