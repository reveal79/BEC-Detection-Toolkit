## 📊 Detection Capabilities

### **1. Malicious Mail Rules**

Detects rules that:

* Hide internal emails (@yourdomain.com)
* Delete messages automatically
* Forward to external addresses
* Move to hidden folders (RSS, Archive)
* Mark as read (hiding new messages)

**Example output:**

```
[!] HIGH RISK RULE DETECTED!
User: user@domain.com
Rule: ...
Actions: Moves to RSS Subscriptions, Marks as read
Targets Internal: Yes
```

### **2. Impossible Travel**

Flags sign-ins from different countries within hours:

```
Route: United States → Russia (45 minutes)
User: executive@domain.com
First IP: 203.0.113.50 | Second IP: 198.51.100.20
```

### **3. Risky Users (Azure AD Identity Protection)**

Integrates with Microsoft's threat intelligence:

* Leaked credentials
* Malicious IP addresses
* Unfamiliar sign-in properties
* Anonymous IPs (Tor, VPN)

### **4. Attack Timeline Reconstruction**

Builds chronological view of compromise:

```
2025-10-20 09:15 - Sign-in from Russia (Risk: High)
2025-10-20 09:20 - Inbox rule created: "..."
2025-10-20 09:25 - 50 emails moved to RSS folder
2025-10-20 09:30 - Password changed
```

## 🔍 Example: Real Incident Response

**Scenario:** User clicks phishing link, credentials stolen, attacker creates malicious mail rules.

**Detection (18 minutes):**

```powershell
PS> .\Scripts\Check-MaliciousMailRules.ps1

[!] HIGH RISK RULE DETECTED!
User: finance@company.com
Rule: "..."
Actions: Hides @company.com emails in RSS folder

Do you want to DISABLE this rule now? (Y/N): Y
[✓] Rule disabled successfully!
```

**Result:** BEC contained in <18 hours, $500K+ fraud prevented.
